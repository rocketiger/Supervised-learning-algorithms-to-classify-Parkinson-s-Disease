The code is written in Jupiter Notebook. In order to make the code work, (1) the code should be executed from top to bottom. (2) the files should be in the same folder as downloaded. 

Both data sets were downloaded from Kaggle.com.
The 1st data is 'pd_speech_features.csv'. The 2nd data is called 'BankChurners.csv', the corresponding Jupiter notebook files are 'P1_PD speech.ipynb' and 'P1_BankChurners.ipynb'. Two python files with some plotting and data conversion functions are 'plotter.py' and 'helper.py'. 

The codes and data can be downloaded: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/svhu096vv6m7wc9/AADaHJzI9VykFwIrp6VXVAD0a?dl=0
